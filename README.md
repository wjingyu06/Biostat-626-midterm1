# Biostat-626-midterm1
## Jingyu Wang's Biostat 626 midterm 1
## Purpose of this project
The purpose of this project is to build 2 classifier, first one is to build a binary classifier to classified the static and dynamic activity, second one is to build a multi-class classifier to classify different moving conditions.

## 626_midterm1_jingyu.Rmd
This Rmd file contains all the code I used for training, evaluation, and generating results for the test data. In the file, I loaded the dataset, conducted Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), performed data pre-processing, built the models, checked the accuracy of the models, and saved the results for the test data. The packages used in this project are listed at the beginning of the file. During the project, I added two features to the training dataset: type 1 and type 2. The type 1 variable was used for binary classification, while the type 2 variable was used for multi-class classification. Additionally, I pre-processed the training and test data into train1, test1, train2, and test2 to help me build the model, test its performance, and generate results for the test data. All the code is contained in this file with comments for clarification.
